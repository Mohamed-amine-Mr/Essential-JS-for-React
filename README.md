Understand immutable data patterns critical for state management

Learn array transformations common in React development

Practice async/await patterns for data fetching

Apply concepts through hands-on exercises

🛠 Core Concepts Covered
🔹 Destructuring
Object destructuring for props and state

Array destructuring with rest operator

🔹 Spread/Rest Operators
Creating new arrays/objects immutably

Combining data sources

🔹 Array Methods
map() for data transformation

filter() for selective rendering

reduce() for aggregation

sort() with immutability

🔹 Modern JavaScript Features
Template literals
